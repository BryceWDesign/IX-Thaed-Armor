Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy  
of this software, hardware design, or related documentation files (the "System"),  
to deal in the System without restriction, including without limitation the rights  
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell  
copies of the System, subject to the following conditions:

1. **CIVILIAN & ENVIRONMENTAL USE ONLY**  
   The System shall only be used for civilian, humanitarian, or environmental safety purposes.  
   Deployment in weapons systems, autonomous offensive platforms, or military kill-chain frameworks  
   is strictly prohibited. Any violation of this clause voids all license rights.

2. **NON-EXPLOITATIVE DEPLOYMENT**  
   The System shall not be used for private profiteering in regions affected by war, disaster, or economic collapse.  
   This license mandates free or low-cost humanitarian deployment wherever lives or ecosystems are at risk.

3. **TRANSPARENCY AND TRACEABILITY**  
   Any use of the System in physical infrastructure (e.g., ships, satellites, filtration arrays)  
   must include publicly accessible documentation stating materials used, energy interfaces, and safety tests performed.

4. **NO EXPORT RESTRICTIONS APPLIED**  
   This System is not subject to ITAR, EAR, or any other export control regulation because it is  
   not a weapon, not classified, and not intended for militarized or state-secret use.  
   It is a civilian-protective technology published in the public interest.

5. **ATTRIBUTION REQUIRED**  
   Any distribution or derivative work must include clear credit to the original creator:  
   *Bryce Wooster*, and reference the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/BryceWDesign/IX-Thaed-Armor`

6. **NO WARRANTY**  
   The System is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to  
   the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement.  
   In no event shall the author be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action  
   of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the System.

7. **FORKING IS ENCOURAGED — ABUSE IS NOT**  
   You are free to fork, remix, and improve the system — but not to corrupt its purpose.  
   Any use-case that knowingly causes harm to civilians, marine life, ecosystems, or peaceful infrastructure  
   is considered a license violation and may trigger legal challenge.

This license shall remain in force indefinitely, and cannot be revoked for any reason other than material breach.  
Use this to protect lives, not to control them.

Signed,
