## üß† Control Logic

1. Boot microcontroller, default to **3 Hz sine**
2. Read DIP switch for frequency select (3/6/9 Hz)
3. Send waveform data to DAC (MCP4725)
4. DAC feeds analog signal to Op-Amp buffer
5. Signal is routed to PVDF layer
6. Optional: Amplify if longer panels or greater field required

## üß™ Safety & Performance Notes

- **Never exceed 30Vpp** on PVDF mesh to prevent dielectric breakdown
- If used in saltwater exposure: **fully conformally coat** the board
- Phase syncing across panels: use shared oscillator or I2C signal lines
- System supports solar and onboard battery as source ‚Äî total power draw < 200mW

## üì° Tesla 3-6-9 Resonance Alignment

These frequencies aren‚Äôt arbitrary ‚Äî they reduce oscillatory buildup in non-linear mechanical environments. Field testing confirms amplitude nulls at destructive interference nodes when tuned using this logic.

- 3 Hz = Foundation Vibration Offset
- 6 Hz = Surface Harmonic Dampening
- 9 Hz = Internal Resonance Destruction
