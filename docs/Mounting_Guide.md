# IX-Thaed-Armor — Structural Mounting Guide  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Applies To:** Maritime and Orbital Panel Deployment  
**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**Objective:** Provide precise instructions for safely installing IX-Thaed-Armor panels on ships, satellites, and industrial surfaces to ensure mechanical stability, vibrational performance, and expansion compliance.

## 📐 Panel Size Reference

- **Standard Unit:** 12” x 12” (1 ft²)
- **Thickness (assembled):** ~6.5mm total (varies by variant)
- **Weight per Unit:** ~75g (marine), ~60g (orbital)

## 🔩 Attachment Methods (By Deployment Zone)

### 🛳️ Maritime (Ship Hull / Platform)

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Bonded Mount** | Adhesive layer using 3M 5200 Marine or Loctite EA9460 over cleaned surface |
| **Elastic Rail Mount** | Encapsulate panel edges in elastomeric C-profile rails bonded to hull |
| **Float Layer (Optional)** | Use air-gapped acoustic foam to reduce hull resonance bleed-through |
| **Sealant** | Edge-seal with epoxy or silicone to prevent corrosion or mesh exposure |

**Panel Expansion Gaps:**  
- Maintain 3–5mm edge gap between panels to allow for thermal expansion and wave distortion

---

### 🛰️ Orbital (Satellite Surface / Rigid Frame)

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Bonded Composite Mount** | Epoxy (space-rated) or thermal adhesive to structural composite surface |
| **Tension Mount System** | Frame-mount with fasteners and preload spacers (carbon or Ti bolts) |
| **Thermal Decoupling** | Use Kapton standoff tape or ceramic insulator washers on mounts |

**Expansion Accommodation:**  
- Design for ±1.5mm lateral movement per 12” panel  
- Edge restraint without overconstraint is critical to avoid warping during orbital day-night cycles

---

## ⚠️ Stress Zone Avoidance

Never drill through any of the following layers:
- Graphene monolayer
- PVDF piezo mesh
- Silicone damping core

**All fasteners must interface with substrate only** or be routed around electrical paths. Use non-conductive adhesives where electrical isolation is needed.

## 🧪 Pre-Install Checklist

| Item | Required Action |
|------|------------------|
| Surface Cleaned | IPA or ethanol, no residue |
| Bonding Layer Mixed | Per spec, no air bubbles |
| Panel Inspection | No warping, cracks, or delamination |
| PVDF Leads Routed | Terminals potted and isolated |
| Mount Clearance Verified | 3–5mm between panels |
| Vibration Isolation Verified | Only on control layer, not core panel |

---

## 🛠️ Tools Required

- Nitrile gloves (anti-static)  
- Adhesive spreader or brush  
- Vacuum clamps (optional for large arrays)  
- Sealant gun (for perimeter edge)  
- Infrared thermometer (for epoxy cure monitoring)  
- Clean air flowbench (optional for orbital build)

---

## 🔒 Maintenance

- Inspect for delamination every 3 months (marine) or per mission milestone (orbital)  
- PVDF tuning lines should be logged in the calibration sheet per panel  
- Remove/reseal only using manufacturer-approved solvents and adhesives

## 🧠 Summary

This guide ensures IX-Thaed-Armor is structurally sound, electrically isolated, and expansion-tolerant under:
- Hull flexure  
- Wave shock  
- Vacuum/thermal distortion  
- EM and vibrational field operation

Mount smart. Let the armor do the work.
