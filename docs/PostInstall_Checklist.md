## üõ†Ô∏è Mechanical Verification

| Test | Method | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Bond Integrity | Manual tug test / tap with mallet | No lift, flex, or delamination observed |
| Panel Flatness | Visual + straightedge | No edge lift >1.5mm |
| Expansion Gap Check | Ruler / caliper | 3‚Äì5mm gap maintained between panels |
| Sealant Coverage | Visual | All edges sealed, no bubbles/cracks |
| Fastener Contact (if any) | Visual + continuity test | No electrical path from bolts to PVDF layer |

## ‚ö° Electrical Verification

| Test | Method | Pass Criteria |
|------|--------|----------------|
| PVDF Lead Continuity | Multimeter | 20‚Äì500Œ© resistance range |
| Ground Isolation | Multimeter | PVDF lines isolated from hull |
| Active Drive Signal | Oscilloscope / logic analyzer | Waveform present at 3, 6, and 9 Hz with <5% distortion |
| Mesh Vibration Response | Laser vibrometer or microphone | Harmonic amplitude matches simulation baseline |
| Harmonic Cancellation Signature | FFT analysis | Frequency dips at 3, 6, and 9 Hz ‚â•10dB below baseline |
