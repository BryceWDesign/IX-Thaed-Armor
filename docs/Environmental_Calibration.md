## 🧠 Tesla 3-6-9 Field Calibration Logic

Harmonic calibration must occur **after mechanical mounting** and **before final sealing**.

### Calibration Steps:
1. Connect PVDF terminal to harmonic generator (AD9850 or AD9833 via microcontroller)
2. Inject sequential drive at:
   - 3 Hz (low-band resonance)
   - 6 Hz (mid-band)
   - 9 Hz (field-cancel harmonic)
3. Use laser vibrometer or accelerometer to measure amplitude cancellation
4. Tune gain and Q damping per PVDF sheet thickness (manufacturer specs)
5. Validate harmonic cancellation with FFT analysis in live system mode

## 🧪 Lifetime Validation Criteria

| Test Type | Metric | Pass Threshold |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Vibration Stress | Cycles at 3–9 Hz | >10⁶ cycles, no delamination |
| Impact Absorption | Drop + harmonics | >40% energy diffusion |
| Adhesion | Peel test | >5 MPa bonding retention |
| Thermal Cycling | -40°C to +100°C | No visual cracks after 25x cycle |
| Signal Integrity | Harmonic response | Amplitude stable ±5% at all drive bands |

## ⚠️ Notes

- Do not attempt to tune system under load (wave or thrust events)  
- Ensure no electrical ground loops exist across piezo array terminals  
- All tuning frequencies must be documented for mission-specific calibration logs
